**MY FIRST JAVASCRIPT PROGRAM!**

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in JavaScript and playable through console.

In this project, I:
* Created JavaScript Functions
* Used the Math.floor() and Math.random() functions to generate random integers
* Called functions within other functions
* Used conditional statements to iterate check for a win, loss, or tie
* Used a for loop to iterate over a function 5 times
* Prompted user for string, made input case-insensitive, checked it against another string
* Probably some more stuff that I'm forgetting about
